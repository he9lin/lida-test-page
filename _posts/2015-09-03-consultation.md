###Fixed Fee

I provide estate planning and business formation services for a fixed-fee and will negotiate a similar structure for other work where I can estimate my time commitment. I typically require a 50% deposit with the balance due upon completion of work.  

###Hourly Billing

For most other legal services, I bill on an hourly basis, plus any costs incurred. This arrangement requires an initial deposit (retainer) placed in a trust account as security against future work.  Clients receive monthly invoices that itemize all work performed and credits any deposits or payments made against the balance due.  

###Contingency Billing

In certain cases, I will represent a client on a contingency basis.  This means the client does not pay for my services until and unless the case is resolved in the client's favor.  This billing is customary for personal injury/wrongful death cases.  Though I typically limit contingency billing to collection claims, I am open to this arrangement for other matters where liability and damages are clear and a specific source of funds to pay the contingency fee exists.

###Consultations

Although I prefer to meet with clients at my office during normal business hours, I realize this may be an inconvenience for those with daytime obligations.  When necessary, I will make myself available to meet during evenings and weekends and, in the event of an emergency, I will be happy to travel to your location for personal consultation and the execution of documents.
